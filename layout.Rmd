# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** ^[Right-upper tab] button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)  # summary of cars
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, fig.cap="Pressure vs Temperature"}
plot(pressure)
```

# Tables

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(
  head(ChickWeight), caption = "Chicky information."
)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(
read.table(header = T, text = "
      Gr     Out  n
      Rx     Imp  8
      Rx Not_Imp  4
 Waiting     Imp  3
 Waiting Not_Imp 10                   
"),
caption = "Patient information"
)
```

Demographic information ^[Cannot set proper caption using markdown table approach.]

Variables | Mean (SD) | n (%)
--- | ---: | ---:
Age | 30 (2.5) | -
Gender (Female) | - | 60 (60%)
Diabetes | - | 40 (40%)
<br />

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(cbind("Variables" = c("Age", "Gender (Female)", "Diabetes"),
      "Mean (SD)" = c("30 (2.5)", "-", "-"),
      "n (%)" = c("-", "60 (60%)", "40 (40%)")
), caption = "Demographic information.")
```
